    "Quantum computations are expressed by quantum circuits, which consist of a list of gates, $G_1G_2...G_k$, each being a unitary matrix (a matrix $U$ is called unitary if $U^{-1}\\,{=}\\,U^\\dagger$).  The basic gates include the identity transformation($Id$) that performs no computation, and Pauli matrices : <br>\n",

However, to implement quantum transformations spanning multiple qubits, we need gates spanning more than one qubit, otherwise known as entangling gates.  It turns out that it suffices to add a very simple gate, called the $\\text{CNOT}$ and defined as follows,\n",

Both leading quantum computing technologies, superconducting circuits and trapped ions, allow a straightforward physical-level implementation of the above gates in practice. In both technologies, the cost of implementing the $\\text{CNOT}$ gate exceeds that of arbitrary single-qubit $U_1$ gates.

    "A quantum circuit is said to implement an $n$-input $m$-output Boolean function $f(x)$ if it computes the transformation $|x,0,0\\rangle \\mapsto e^{i\\theta(x)}|x,f(x),0\\rangle$ for some arbitrary real-valued function $\\theta(x)$, i.e., first part of the register passes unchanged, the second part accumulates the bit values of the desired function $f(x)$, and the third part, with $S$ qubits, is used as a computational scratch space. When $\\theta(x) \\equiv 2\\pi$, implying $e^{i\\theta(x)} \\equiv 1$, the implementation is called phaseless.  We consider the phase $\\theta(x)$ irrelevant in what follows, which is consistent with measuring the $m$ output bits immediately after implementing the circuit. Allowing the phase to take different values depending on the input introduces a degree of freedom that can be explored to obtain shorter circuits, as there are fewer conditions for the circuit to satisfy.  The total number of qubits spanned by such a circuit is $n\\,{+}\\,m\\,{+}\\,S$.  Note that the $S$-qubit scratch space needs to be returned to value $|0\\rangle$ as otherwise, the implementation may not be used in quantum algorithms due to unwanted entanglement residing on the unreset scratch qubits.\n"
